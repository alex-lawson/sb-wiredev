==========

Finished object code and scripts for wire objects to be integrated into Starbound

Finished or Nearly Finished
---
- new scripts (alarm.lua, button.lua, lightsensor.lua, wiretable.lua)
- updated scripts (motiondetector.lua, switch.lua)
- names and generic descriptions for logic gates
- new objects (alarm, lightsensor, pressureplate, smallbackgroundbutton, smallbackgroundswitch)
- wire crafting table object, which also functions as 2 indicator bulbs

Placeholder Content
---

- all images
- recipe costs
- pixel values (though the objects are currently set to not be printable/scannable)

Outstanding Needs
---

- race-specific descriptions?
- determine 'complete' vs 'prototype' object structure (e.g. lightsensor is a full object with its own scripts, pressureplate is built on the motiondetector prototype)
- more complete crafting interface configuration?
